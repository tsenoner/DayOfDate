# DayOfDate
This is a simple python GUI to learn + train + track your own progress on an algorithmic process to **determina the day of the week** for any date.

You can find a simple YouTube explaination [hier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=714LTMNJy5M&t=140s).
The method is based on the [Doomsday rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule) devised by [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).
